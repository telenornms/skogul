/*
Now returns an approximation of time.Now atomically. It his is achieved by
syncing time in a separate go routine to reduce overhead. Currently synced
10 times per second. The reason you may want this is:

	BenchmarkTimeNow-8     	130269282	        45.6 ns/op
	BenchmarkSkogulNow-8   	1000000000	         0.878 ns/op

If ten times per second isn't accurate enough, we may consider making this
configurable. The primary use case here is for transformers or parsers that
need to insert time, but might get thousands of metrics per second.
