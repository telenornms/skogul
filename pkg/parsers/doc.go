Package parsers is responsible for interpreting raw byte data into
Containers. Each parser is disconnected from how the byte data is received
and what happens with it afterwards.

The simplest parser is probably the JSON parser, which simply assumes the
byte slice is a JSON representation of a Skogul Container.
