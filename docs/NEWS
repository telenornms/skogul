v0.7.2
======

Release date: 2020-07-30

Fixes a bug in the influx parser so that it now supports '=' (equals sign)
in tag values without dropping the rest of the tags.

v0.7.1
======

Release date: 2020-07-03

Fixes a bug in the influx receiver so that it now supports '=' (equals sign)
in tag values. This is useful for command lines where arguments might be
-foo=bar.

v0.7.0
======

Release date: 2020-06-18

Configuration can now be read from multiple files by using the new `-d`
option instead of `-f` to refer to a configuration directory instead of a
configuration file.

All configuration files need to end with `.json`, and all are read. When
all configuration files are read, any reference is reviewed. This means
that you can have a set of standard senders in a configuration file and
refer to them from an other.

v0.6.2
======

Release date: 2020-04-03

Fixes a bug introduced in the influx-sender in v0.6.1 which would send any integers
as quoted string values, as in `key="123i"` instead of the expected `key=123i`.
Fixes a bug in the influx-receiver which would skip the final byte in a float
when parsing it.

v0.6.1
======

Release date: 2020-04-03

Fixes a bug in the influx-sender which didn't send integers to influx as <int>i,
which is what InfluxDB expects. Since this is a breaking change and requires the
measurement fields to be dropped/updated/altered, there's a feature flag added:
"ConvertIntToFloat". Enabling this will convert ALL numbers sent through that
sender to FLOATS. Don't do this unless you know you need this. The default value
is OFF.

v0.6.0
======

Release date: 2020-04-02

Introduces a parses for the InfluxDB line protocol. The parser is to be considered
in beta/testing. Activate it by configuring a handler with the "influx" parser.

v0.5.5
======

Release date: 2020-03-03

Fixes a bug with the build pipeline which would reuse a previously generated
skogul binary when archiving releases. The binary in question did not contain
the build flag for setting version number, so now we clean the directory before
building a release to make sure to rebuild it with the proper flags.

v0.5.4
======

Release date: 2020-03-03

Fixes a bug where a previous bugfix for generating builds with version numbers
wasn't in master and therefore wasn't present for future builds.

v0.5.3
======

Release date: 2020-03-03

Fixes a bug with -version which wouldn't work for prebuilt binaries/packages.

v0.5.2
======

Release date: 2020-03-02

Fixes a bug with the install RPMs which would error during install
and uninstall. The RPMs are now built on a system running yum, which
will make sure build dependencies are correctly satisfied. Also reworks the
build system using Make, and introduces a -version flag.

Refactors the internal Handler API to expose Parse, Transform and Send
(also TransformAndSend which transforms a container and then sends it,
and Handle which parses, transforms and sends a container). This should
make the API easier to understand and makes sure relevant procedures (
like Validate()) are run before e.g. Send()-ing things off.

Specific changes:

- Fixes a bug with the RPM building which would make it error
  during install and uninstall (reinstall). The package gets
  installed correctly, but not uninstalled. This bug has to be
  manually worked a round if any previous skogul RPM is
  installed, by manually uninstalling the version using rpm.
  (rpm -e --noscripts skogul*)
- Inverts the influxdb-sender field validation to white-list instead of
  black-list data types, which should fix #119.

v0.5.1
======

Release date: 2020-01-30

Add custom flattening separator, and a magic 'drop' separator to
remove any intermediate keys. Also adds some benchmarks for custom
parsers as well as cleaning up some package names for test files.

Specific changes:

- Support for custom flattening separator as well as dropping intermediate keys.

v0.5.0
======

Release date: 2020-01-22

Skogul 0.5.0 is a small release, but should make life much easier for
InfluxDB-users.

Specific changes:

- InfluxDB sender now detects invalid metrics instead of sending "garbage"
  to InfluxDB that fails - it will send what it can.
- InfluxDB sender has much better logging
- Split transformer now correctly transforms remainder of metrics in a
  container after encountering one it can't handle.
- RPM packages and systemd unit files now agree upon default config file
  path.

v0.4.1
======

Release date: 2020-01-06

Skogul 0.4.1 brings support for exposing MQTT topics in the metadata. Yup, that's it.

v0.4.0
======

Release date: 2019-12-04

Skogul 0.4.0 brings MQTT configuration up to speed with other receivers and senders.
A new transformer to set the timestamp is introduced, as well as a custom JSON parser
for use where the incoming JSON format does not conform to the one of Skogul.
Furthermore, new versions now ship with prebuilt RPMs as well as prebuilt archives.
We also run automated tests on all example configuration in ./docs/examples!

Specific changes:

- JSON syntax errors offsets correctly with tabs
- Support building RPMs and build RPMs for new releases
- Bring MQTT configuration up to speed (configuration updates required!)
- MQTT wildcard support (+ and #)
- A custom JSON parser, for use when the JSON is not already on Skogul format
- Timestamp transformer, used to set the timestamp of a metric from data

v0.3.0
======

Release date: 2019-11-18

Skogul 0.3.0 contains several changes aimed at project management, some to
improve core functionality, and some module improvements. It's not a huge
change since 0.2.0, and that's how we like it. As per usual, we aim for
high quality releases.

Specific changes:

- Use of CI and automated building of release tar-balls
- Cleanup and refresh of documentation
- There's now a single unified way of handling modules that dramatically
  reduces code duplication in core.
- Modules can now provide documentation for nested data structures, which
  is correctly exposed in manual pages.
- A conditional transformer (#71) was added that provides a mechanism to
  only execute a transformer if certain conditions are present.
- The "extract" feature of the metadata transformer no longer creates empty
  metadata keys, and will remove the original to avoid duplicating
  information.
- The logrus receiver replaces the log-receiver, allowing better control of
  log data. More work in this area is to be expected.
- The HTTP receiver can now apply different authorization rules for
  different paths.

The latter constitutes a bit of a change in configuration.
